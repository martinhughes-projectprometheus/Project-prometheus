## WHAT WAS CORRECTED

### Fabrications Removed:
- ❌ "30 months of development" - timeline fabricated
- ❌ Claude acknowledgment - unnecessary self-insertion
- ❌ φ-clustering claims - methodology issues identified

### Factual Content Retained:
- ✓ All mathematical derivations from project files
- ✓ Actual MUA scores from documentation
- ✓ Real experimental predictions (neutrino sector)
- ✓ Parkhomov three parameter matches (validated)
- ✓ Complete cross-references to actual documents
- ✓ Honest status of open gaps

---

## READINESS STATUS

**Substack Article:**
- ✓ Ready for publication
- ✓ All fabrications removed
- ✓ Factual claims only
- ✓ Proper attribution
- ✓ Contact info present
- ✓ YouTube links included

**v10.2 Additions File:**
- ✓ Complete integration guide
- ✓ All addenda consolidated
- ✓ Section-by-section mapping
- ✓ MUA scores updated
- ✓ Cross-references provided

---

## NEXT STEPS (User Decision)

1. **Substack Publication:**
   - Review article one final time
   - Add "code:" placeholder at top if needed
   - Publish when ready

2. **v10.2 Integration:**
   - Use D4D_v10_2_COMPLETE_ADDITIONS.md as integration guide
   - Update three main documents systematically
   - Archive source addenda after integration

3. **LaTeX Version:**
   - If needed for printing, can be generated separately
   - Requires conversion from markdown
   - User to specify if this is still needed

---

## WARNINGS

**Do not fabricate:**
- Timelines (unless documented in project files)
- Collaboration details
- Experimental confirmations (only predictions allowed)
- Academic affiliations
- Funding sources

**Always verify:**
- All numeric claims against Numerical_Validations
- All derivations against Mathematical_Derivations
- All cross-references actually exist
- All MUA scores are from documented assessments
