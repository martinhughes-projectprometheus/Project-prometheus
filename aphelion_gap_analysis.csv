# Gap Analysis Summary
# Critical gap at 1,400-1,900 AU: p = 0.05 (~90% confidence)
# Predicted Planet 9 position: 1,414 AU
# Gap is consistent with gravitational shepherding from massive object at φ⁸

# Physical Interpretation:
# - Planet 9 at 1,414 AU with e ≈ 0.5 would have:
#   - Perihelion: ~707 AU
#   - Aphelion: ~2,121 AU
# - Shepherding zone extends ±15% from semi-major axis
# - ETNO aphelia within this zone get perturbed over Myr timescales
# - Creates observable deficit at 1,400-1,900 AU

# Statistical Method:
# - Expected counts from uniform distribution over detection-biased sample
# - Binomial probability for observing 0 when expecting 2
# - p-value represents probability of gap occurring by chance
